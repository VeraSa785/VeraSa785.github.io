    <h1>Who is Vera?</h1>
    <h2>A Software Engineer Student at Ada Developers Academy.</h2>
    
    <p>I have studied Python, SQL & Flask, CSS, HTML at the 17th Cohort of the 
      Ada Developers Academy. I exited to find my first job to take opportunity to start my new career!</p>

    <p>In the past I did a master degree in economics and have 5 years of experience as an accountant in Russia. 
      Since I moved to the USA six years ago, I should start over my career. I asked myself, what am I really in 
      love to do? I love numbers, mathematics and I can concentrate on things for a long time. I like to do 
      intellectual tasks. I am passionate about doing logical puzzles, taking quizzes, and playing problem-solving 
      games. All of these thoughts led me to explore programming.</p>
    
    <p>I am happiest when I creating, exploring and learning and thinking how to make things better. I took different 
      courses to explore Python in the Coursera and the Udemy online platforms. I took a part of the Code in place course 
      by Stanford University. Today I luckily have the opportunity to be a student at Ada Developers Academy!</p>

    <p>Being a diligent, hardworking and result oriented lady, I always work towards achieving best result on each 
      project I lay my hands on.</p>
